## Spreadsheet Application with Mini-Game Integration

- Developed a Java-based spreadsheet application with formula parsing, arithmetic operations, and custom file format saving/loading
- Integrated games (Tetris, Conway's Game of Life, Snake) using cellular automaton logic, event-driven movement, and collision detection
- Enhanced software design with JUnit testing, SOLID principles, low coupling, and high cohesion for extensibility
